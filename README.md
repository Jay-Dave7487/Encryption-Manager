As the name suggests, this Android app is a password manager, and it's main feature is that it has no online capabilities - your passwords are saved only on your device.

If you are concerned about having your passwords in the cloud, on some company's server, or in some hackable honey-pot, then this app might be for you.

If you worry about secret coercion, or data sovereignty, or you've heard of password managers leaking, or worry about the flood of cracked passwords eroding the security of the master password for your online password DB, then this app might be for you.
